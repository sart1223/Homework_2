The secondof them--the “Process of Historical Proof,” was, in fact, a sequel tothe first--the “History of the Transmission of Ancient Books to ModernTimes.” In now reprinting the two, as one, it has not been difficultto give continuity to the whole: this has been effected, partly byremoving from each volume portions which seemed to be of secondaryimportance, and to be not closely related to the principal intentionof the work; and partly by introducing several entire chapters of newmaterial; and by the insertion of additional paragraphs throughout.What is new in this volume occurs chiefly in the mid portions of it,and at the end.In the course of this thirty years, the labours of critics, combinedwith the researches of learned travellers, have thrown much light uponall parts of the subject which is compendiously treated in this volume.No reader who is fully informed in this department will need to be toldthat, within the limits of a volume such as this, nothing more than themost concise mention of these recent labours and researches could beattempted: they are referred to only in the way of suggestion and ofsample. At the first, the two books above mentioned were intended tofind a place in a course of general educational reading; and it is onlyas coming within the range of a purpose such as this, that the Reprintis now offered to the public.In excluding from the Reprint some chapters of the two volumes whichrelated expressly to the Biblical argument, or “Christian Evidences,”I have been influenced by several reasons--such as these: The firstof them is this, that what may be regarded as the _religious_ aspectof the general subject has no direct claim to be included in thetreatment of it. In the next place, I have believed--and think sodecisively--that, for the very purpose of bringing the Biblicalargument home, with the greatest force, to the convictions ofintelligent young persons, the subject should be fully understoodin its broadest aspect. When it is thus presented, and when it isthus understood, well-informed and ingenuous persons will see andfeel, irresistibly, that, as compared with any other mass of factsbelonging to literary antiquarianism, and to historic evidence, theBiblical evidence is many times more ample, and various, and is moreunquestionably certain, than even the best and the surest of thosemasses of facts.There is yet another reason that has induced me to retrench, inthis Reprint, much that, thirty years ago, might seem proper to thetreatment of the subject. In this course of time a great change hashad place upon the field of argument touching Christianity and itsorigin. Although disbelief may have spread widely of late, the argumentconcerning Christianity has been narrowed on every side of it. Muchthat, a while ago, was thought to need the production of proof, has,within a few years, quite ceased to be spoken of as questionable.Several elaborate and ingenious endeavours to bring, first, the_documents_ of Christianity, and then, the _historic import_ ofthose documents, into doubt, have signally failed, and in fact theyare abandoned as nugatory and hopeless. It would, therefore, be asuperfluous labour at this time to defend positions which have ceasedto be assailed.The course of adverse thought, at this time, in relation to thereligion of Christ--the only religion concerning which any question canbe raised--has this tendency, namely, to divert attention by all means,and as much as possible, from _the past_; and to engage all attention,and to concentrate it, upon the _present moment_, and upon its tangibleand secular interests. This is now the aim of those writers, in thedepartments of Philosophy--physical and abstract, who would subvertChristianity, and who labour to do so by drawing the thoughts of theeducated classes away from it--away from its neighbourhood. If it beso, then it must be well for those who take the other side, to do whatthey may for calling back the same classes, and for challenging them toacquaint themselves anew with History, and to assure themselves of itsincontestible certainty.  STANFORD RIVERS,  _February, 1859_.CONTENTS.  CHAPTER I.                                                                    PAGE  INTENTION OF THE PRESENT ARGUMENT                                    1  CHAPTER II.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE, AS TO THE AUTHENTICITY OF ANCIENT BOOKS       9  CHAPTER III.  THE DATE OF ANCIENT WORKS, INFERRED FROM THE QUOTATIONS  AND REFERENCES OF CONTEMPORARY AND SUCCEEDING WRITERS               28  CHAPTER IV.  THE ANTIQUITY AND GENUINENESS OF ANCIENT BOOKS MAY BE INFERRED FROM  THE HISTORY OF THE LANGUAGES IN WHICH THEY ARE EXTANT               36  CHAPTER V.  ANCIENT METHODS OF WRITING, AND THE MATERIALS OF BOOKS              41  CHAPTER VI.  CHANGES INTRODUCED IN THE COURSE OF TIME IN THE FORMS OF LETTERS,  AND IN THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF WRITING                             52  CHAPTER VII.  THE COPYISTS; AND THE PRINCIPAL CENTRES OF THE COPYING BUSINESS     61  CHAPTER VIII.  INDICATIONS OF THE SURVIVANCE OF ANCIENT LITERATURE, THROUGH A PERIOD  EXTENDING FROM THE DECLINE OF LEARNING IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY, TO ITS  RESTORATION IN THE FIFTEENTH                                        77  CHAPTER IX.  THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY                   97  CHAPTER X.  SEVERAL METHODS AVAILABLE FOR ASCERTAINING THE CREDIBILITY  OF ANCIENT HISTORICAL WORKS                                        102  CHAPTER XI.  EXCEPTIONS TO WHICH THE TESTIMONY OF HISTORIANS, ON PARTICULAR  POINTS, MAY BE LIABLE                                              119  CHAPTER XII.  CONFIRMATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE OF ANCIENT HISTORIANS, DERIVABLE  FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES                                           132  CHAPTER XIII.  GENERAL PRINCIPLES, APPLICABLE TO QUESTIONS OF THE GENUINENESS  AND AUTHENTICITY OF ANCIENT RECORDS                                160  CHAPTER XIV.  RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE EVIDENCE WHICH SUPPORTS THE GENUINENESS  AND AUTHENTICITY OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES                            177  CHAPTER XV.  ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PRECEDING STATEMENTS:--A MORNING AT  THE BRITISH MUSEUM                                                 204  CHAPTER XVI.  FACTS RELATING TO THE CONSERVATION, AND LATE RECOVERY, OF  SOME ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS                                           226  CHAPTER XVII.  THE PROCESS OF HISTORIC EVIDENCE EXEMPLIFIED IN THE INSTANCE  OF HERODOTUS                                                       267  CHAPTER XVIII.  METHOD OF ARGUING FROM THE GENUINENESS, TO THE AUTHENTICITY  OF THE HISTORY OF HERODOTUS                                        306  CHAPTER XIX.  EXAMPLES OF IMPERFECT HISTORICAL EVIDENCE:--HERODOTUS              336  CHAPTER XX.  RECENT EXPLORATIONS, CONFIRMATORY OF THE TRUTH OF ANCIENT  HISTORY: HERODOTUS AND BEROSUS                                     358  CHAPTER XXI.  INFERENTIAL HISTORIC MATERIALS                                     371  CHAPTER XXII.  THE MODERN JERUSALEM--A VOUCHER FOR THE LITERATURE OF ITS  ANCIENT OCCUPANTS                                                  399HISTORYOF THETRANSMISSION OF ANCIENT BOOKS.CHAPTER I.INTENTION OF THE PRESENT ARGUMENT.The credit of ancient literature, the certainty of history, and thetruth of religion, are all involved in the secure transmission ofancient books to modern times. Many of the facts connected with thehistory of this transmission are to be found, more or less distinctlymentioned, in every work in which the claims of the Holy Scriptures areadvocated. But these facts are open to much misapprehension when theyare brought together to subserve the purposes of a single argument. Itis the intention of this volume therefore to lay them before generalreaders, as they stand apart from controversy, and as if no interestsmore important than those of literature were implicated in the resultof the statements we have to make.Nothing can be more equitable than that the genuineness andauthenticity of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures should be judgedof by the rules that are applied to all other ancient books; nor isanything more likely to produce a firm and intelligent convictionof the validity of the claims advanced for the Holy Scriptures,than a clear understanding of the relative value of the evidencewhich supports them. To furnish the means therefore of instituting acomparison, so just in itself, and so necessary to a fair examinationof the most important of all questions, is the design of these pages.As this volume makes no pretension to communicate information to thosewho are already conversant with matters of antiquity, literary orhistorical, whatever might seem recondite, or what is still involvedin controversy, has been avoided. Nor will these pages be encumberedwith numerous references, which, though easily amassed, would increasethe size of the volume without being serviceable to the class ofreaders for whom the author now writes. No facts are adduced whichmay not readily be substantiated by any one who has access to alibrary of moderate extent. But a few works, not often met with inprivate collections, are named at the foot of the page where specialinformation has been derived from them.The principal facts of ancient history, and the authenticity of theworks from which chiefly our knowledge of antiquity is derived, are nowfreely admitted, after a few exceptive instances have been set off,which are unproved, or doubtful.Yet on this subject, as well as upon some others, there often exists,at the same time, too much faith, and too little; for, from a wantof acquaintance with the details on which-a rational conviction ofthe genuineness and validity of ancient records may be founded, manypersons, even though otherwise well informed, feel that they havehardly an alternative between a simple acceptance of the entire mass ofancient history, or an equally indiscriminate suspicion of the whole.And when it happens that a particular fact comes to be questioned, orwhen the genuineness of some ancient book is argued, such persons,conscious that they are little familiar with the nature of the evidenceon the strength of which the question turns, and perceiving that thecontroversy involves many recondite and uninteresting researches, orthat it rests upon the validity of minute criticisms, either recoilaltogether from the argument, or they accept an opinion, withoutinquiry, from that party on whose judgment they think they may mostsafely rely.And it is true that such controversies may, for the most part, veryproperly be left in the hands of critics and antiquarians, whose tastesand acquirements qualify them for investigations that can scarcely bemade intelligible to the mass of readers. Nor are the facts involvedin these controversies often of any importance to the general studentof history; for they do not extensively affect the integrity of thatdepartment of literature to which they belong. Yet it must be allowedthat the _principles_ on which such questions are argued, and thefacts connected with the transmission of ancient literature to moderntimes, are in themselves highly important; and that they well deservemore attention than they often receive. Nor are these facts, whenseparated from particular controversies, at all abstruse, or difficultof apprehension. Indeed much of the information that bears upon thesubject is in itself curious and highly interesting, as well asimportant.Even in relation to those works of genius, the value of which consistsin their intrinsic merits, and which would not be robbed of theirbeauties, though they were discovered to be spurious, an assuranceof their genuineness is felt by every reader to conduce greatly tothe pleasure they impart. But a much stronger feeling naturally leadsus to demand this assurance in the perusal of works which professto have reality only for their matter:--Truth is the very subjectof History:--the adducing of satisfactory evidence, therefore, ofthe integrity of its records may well be deemed an indispensablepreliminary to a course of study in that department of knowledge.Besides its peculiar propriety in connexion with the study of history,the argument in support of the genuineness and authenticity of theexisting remains of ancient literature is singularly fitted to afforda useful exercise to the reasoning faculties; and perhaps, betterthan any other subject, it calls into combined action those powers ofthe mind that are separately employed in mathematical, physical, orlegal pursuits, and which, in the actual occasions of common life, cansubserve our welfare only so far as they move in unison.But reasons of still greater moment recommend the subject of thefollowing pages to the attention of the reader; for it is certain thatevery one, whether or not he is contented to admit, without inquiry,the authenticity of _profane_ history, has the highest personal concernin the truth of that particular portion of ancient history with whichthe Christian religion is connected; and, therefore, every one shouldthink himself bound to convince himself of the genuineness of the booksin which its principles are contained. And as the facts on which thisproof depends are precisely of the same kind in profane, as in sacredliterature, and as the same principles of evidence are applicableto all questions relating to the genuineness of ancient books, itis highly desirable that the proof of the genuineness of the SacredWritings should be viewed--in _its place_, as forming a part only of ageneral argument, which bears equally upon the entire literary remainsof antiquity. For it is only when so viewed, that the comparativestrength and completeness of the proof which belongs to this particularcase, can be duly estimated. When exhibited in this light it willbe seen that the integrity of the records of the Christian faithis substantiated by evidence in a tenfold proportion more various,copious, and conclusive, than that which can be adduced in support ofany other ancient writings. If, therefore, the question had no otherimportance belonging to it than what may attach to a purely literaryinquiry, or if only the strict justice of the case were regarded, theauthenticity of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures could never come tobe controverted, till the entire body of classical literature had beenproved to be spurious.Many--perhaps most persons, in perusing works on the evidences ofrevealed religion, are apt to suppose that the sacred books only, orthat these books, more than any others, stand in need of labouredargumentation in support of their authenticity; while, in truth,these books, less than any other ancient writings, need a carefulinvestigation of their claims; for the proof that establishes themis on all points obvious and redundant. Indeed this very redundancyand variety of evidence--especially if it be unskilfully adduced, mayactually produce confusion and hesitancy, rather than an affirmedconviction, in unpractised minds; and this perplexity is likely to beincreased by the very idea of the serious importance of the subject.Thus it may happen that those very facts which, if compared with othersof a similar kind, are susceptible of the most complete proof, areactually regarded with the most distrust.In presenting to the reader, what might be called--the History of therecords of History, we shall put him in position for tracing the extantworks of ancient authors _retrogressively_, from modern times, up tothe age to which they are usually attributed; and then it will be seenon what grounds--under certain limitations--the contents of these worksare admitted to be authentic, and worthy of credit. In attending to thefacts which we have to adduce it will appear that we are well warrantedin accepting certain works as having been written in the age to whichthey are usually assigned, and by the authors to whom they are commonlyattributed; and also in believing that they have not suffered materialcorruption in the course of transcription.Further than this we may advance, and go on to show the grounds ofour belief that such or such an author wrote what he believed to betrue, and that he possessed authentic information on the subject ofwhich he treats. The proof in this case must be drawn from the styleand character of the work itself; from the circumstances that attendedits first publication; from the corroborative evidence of contemporarywriters; and from the agreement of the narrative in particularinstances with existing relics of antiquity.Evidence in support of the first part of this assumption will provethat the works in question are not _forgeries_:--evidence establishingthe _second_, will show that they are not _fictions_.It is obvious that these assumptions are not only distinct, butthat they are independent of each other:--for one of them may beconclusively established, while the other is either disproved, or mayremain questionable. A book may contain a true narrative of events,though not written by the author, or in the age, that has commonly beensupposed. Or, on the other hand, it may undoubtedly be the productionof the alleged author, but may deserve little credit as a professedrecord of facts. Thus, for example, the Cyropædia is, on good evidence,attributed to Xenophon; but there is little reason to suppose that itdeserves to be considered as better than an historical romance:--the_genuineness_ of the work is certain; but its authenticity as a historyis, at the best, questionable. Yet the first of these propositions ismore independent of the second, than the second can be of the first.For when the antiquity and genuineness of an historical work hasbeen clearly demonstrated, it is seldom difficult to fix the degreeof credit that is due to the author; or to discover those particularpoints on which there may be reason to suspect his veracity, or toquestion the soundness of his judgment, or to doubt the accuracy of hisinformation.It is then for the purpose of rendering these arguments and inferencesintelligible, and more satisfactory also, than otherwise they would be,that, after giving a brief statement of this argument, we shall proceedto bring forward what relates to the manipulative and mechanicalmethods of multiplying copies of books, and to the diffusion, andpreservation of these copies, in ancient times;--that is to say, in alltimes anterior to the invention of Printing, in the fifteenth century.CHAPTER II.STATEMENT OF THE CASE, AS TO THE AUTHENTICITY OF ANCIENT BOOKS.The antiquity and genuineness of the extant remains of ancientliterature may be established by three lines of proof that arealtogether independent of each other; and though, in any particularinstance, one, or even two out of the three should be wanting, theremaining one may alone be perfectly conclusive:--When the threeconcur, they present a redundant demonstration of the facts in question.The _first_ line of proof relates to the history of certain copies of awork, which are now in existence.The _second_--traces the history of a work as it may be collected fromthe series of references made to it by succeeding writers.The _third_--is drawn from the known history of the _language_ in whichthe work is extant.For understanding what belongs to the first of these three lines ofevidence we ought to be acquainted with various particulars relatingto the modes of writing practised among ancient nations, and to thematerials employed, and to what may be called the business-system bymeans of which an ancient writer placed himself in communication withhis readers.In many, or in most of these particulars ancient and modern usages arevery dissimilar. But something more should first be said indicative ofthe purpose with a view to which these facts are brought forward.It need scarcely be said that the antiquity and integrity of a bookcan be open to no question, if in any case the existence of any onecopy of it can be traced back, with certainty, to the time of itsfirst publication. If, for example, a manuscript of a work in theauthor’s handwriting were still extant, and if the fact of its beingsuch could by any means be proved, our argument would be concluded, andany other evidence must be deemed superfluous. There are however fewsuch unquestionable _autographs_ to be found, even of modern works,and none, of any ancient one. Yet the circumstances attending thepreservation and transmission of manuscripts are, in some instances, aswe shall see, such as to prove the antiquity and genuineness of a workwith little less certainty than as if the very first copy of it were inexistence.But before we enter into the particulars of this proof it shouldbe mentioned--especially as we intend to follow the order of time_retrogressively_, that the history of _manuscripts_ need not be tracedthrough any later period than that of the early part of the fifteenthcentury, when most of the classic authors passed through the press.For the invention of printing has served, as well to ascertain,beyond doubt, the existence of books at certain dates, as to securethe text from extensive interpolation and corruption. A printed bookis not susceptible of subsequent interpolation or alteration by the_pen_: it bears also a date, and the issuing of different editionsof the same work from distant places, would render any falsificationof date in one of them, or any material corruption of the text by aneditor, a nugatory attempt. For example, there are now extant, printedcopies of the history of the Peloponnesian war, dated “Venice, 1502;”other copies of an edition of the same work are dated “Florence,1506;” others are dated “Basil, 1540;” and others, printed within afew years of the same time at Paris and Vienna. On being comparedwith each other, these editions are found to agree _in the main_; andyet to disagree in many small variations of orthography, syntax, orexpression; so as to prove that they were derived independently fromdifferent manuscripts; and not successively from each other. Theseprinted editions, therefore, sufficiently prove the existence of thework in the fifteenth century; and also that the text of the moderneditions has not been materially impaired or corrupted during the lastfour hundred years.But let it now be imagined, that there are no other means ofascertaining the antiquity and genuineness of the classic authors thansuch as may be collected from the history of existing manuscripts. Ourobject then will be to discover to what age they may clearly be traced;and to deduce from the facts some sure inference relative to the lengthof time during which those works have been passing through the handsof copyists.The date of an ancient manuscript may be ascertained by such means asthe following:--1. Some manuscripts are known to have been carefully preserved in thelibraries where they are now found, for several centuries:--for notonly have they been mentioned in the catalogues of the depositoriesto which they belong, but they have been so accurately described byeminent scholars of succeeding ages, that no doubt can remain of theiridentity. Or even if they have changed hands, the particulars of thesuccessive transfers have been authentically recorded.2. A large proportion of existing manuscripts are found to be dated bythe hand of the copyists, and in such a manner as to leave no questionas to the time when the copy was executed.3. Many manuscripts have marginal notes, added evidently by laterhands, which through some incidental allusion to persons, events, orparticular customs, or by the use of peculiar forms of expression,indicate clearly the age of the notes, and therefore carry that of theoriginal manuscript somewhat higher.4. The remote antiquity of a manuscript is often established by thepeculiar circumstance of its existing _beneath_ another writing.These re-written manuscripts--palimpsests, or rescripts, as they aretermed, afford the most satisfactory proof of antiquity that can beimagined. Parchment, which has always been a costly material, came tobe greatly enhanced in price at the time when paper, manufactured fromthe papyrus of the Nile, began to be scarce, and just before the timewhen that formed from cotton--called charta bombycina, was broughtinto general use. At the same period, owing to the general declineof learning, the works of the classic authors fell into very generalneglect. Those, therefore, who were copyists by profession, and themonks especially, whose libraries often contained large collections ofparchment books, availed themselves of the valuable material which theypossessed, by erasing, or washing out, the original writing, and thensubstituting lives of the saints, religious romances, meditations, orsuch other inanities as suited the taste of the times. Nevertheless,often, the faithful skin, tenacious of its pristine honours, retainedthe traces of the original writing with sufficient distinctness torender it still legible. These rescripts, therefore, offer to us adouble proof of the antiquity of the work which first occupied theparchment; for in most cases the date of the monkish writing iseasily ascertained to be of the twelfth, or even the ninth century.The writing which _first_ occupied such parchments must, of course,be dated considerably higher; for it is much more probable that old,than that recent books should have been selected for the purpose oferasure. Some invaluable manuscripts of the Holy Scriptures, and not afew precious fragments of classic literature, have been thus brought tolight.5. The age of a manuscript may often be ascertained, with little chanceof error, by some such indications as the following:--the quality orappearance of the ink; the nature of the material; that is to say,whether it be soft leather, or parchment, or the papyrus of Egypt,or the bombycine paper; for these materials succeeded each other, incommon use, at periods that are well known;--the peculiar form, size,and character of the writing; for a regular progression in the modes ofwriting may be traced by abundant evidence through every age from theremotest times;--the style of the ornaments or _illuminations_, as theyare termed, often serves to indicate the age of the book which theydecorate.From such indications as these, more or less definite and certain,ancient manuscripts, now extant, are assigned to various periods,extending from the sixteenth, to the fourth century of the Christianera; or perhaps, in one or two instances, to the third, or second. Veryfew can claim an antiquity so high as the fourth century: but not a feware safely attributed to the seventh; and a great proportion of thoseextant were unquestionably executed in the tenth; while many belong tothe following four hundred years. It is, however, to be observed, thatsome manuscripts, executed at so late a time as the thirteenth, or eventhe fifteenth century, afford clear internal evidence that, by a singleremove only, the text they contain claims a _real_ antiquity, higherthan that even of the oldest existing copy of the same work. For theseolder copies sometimes prove, by the peculiar nature of the corruptionswhich have crept into the text, that they have been derived througha long series of copies; while perhaps the text of the more modernmanuscript possesses such a degree of purity and freedom from all theusual consequences of frequent transcription, as to make it manifestthat the copy from which it was taken, was so ancient as not to be fardistant from the time of the first publication of the work.Most, if not all, the Royal and Ecclesiastical and University librariesin Europe, as well as many private collections, contain great numbersof these literary relics of antiquity: and some of them could furnishmanuscripts of nearly the entire body of ancient literature. Thereare few of the classic authors that are not still extant in _several_manuscript copies; and of some, the existing copies are almostnumberless.Although all the larger ancient libraries, such, for example, asthose of Alexandria, of Constantinople, of Athens, and of Rome, weredestroyed by the fanaticism of barbarian conquerors; yet so extensivea diffusion of the most celebrated works had previously taken place,throughout the Roman empire, and beyond its limits, that all parts ofEurope and Western Asia abounded with smaller collections, or withsingle works in the hands of private persons. When learning had almostdisappeared among the people, monasteries and religious houses becamethe chief receptacles of books; for almost every such establishmentincluded individuals who still cultivated literature and the scienceswith ardour; and who found no difficulty in amassing almost anyquantity of this generally neglected property.Happily for literature, religious houses were places of greatersecurity than even the strongholds of the nobles, or the palacesof kings, which by conquest or revolution were, from time to time,violently rent from their possessors. Meantime, these sacred seclusionswere usually respected, even by the fiercest invaders. Through along course of ages, monasteries were occupied by an order of menwho succeeded each other in a far more tranquil course of transitionthan has taken place in any other instance, that might be named. Theproperty of each establishment (and its literary property was alwayshighly prized) passed down, from age to age, as if under the handof a permanent proprietor, and it was therefore subjected to fewerdispersions or destructions than the mutability of human affairsordinarily permits.Every church, and every convent and monastery had its library, itslibrarian, and its other officers, employed in the conservation of thebooks. Connected with the library was the _Scriptorium_--the hall orchamber where the elder or the educated monks employed themselves inmaking copies of such books as were falling into decay; or of such asthere was still some demand for, in the open world.By means such as these it was that the literature of more enlightenedages has been preserved from extinction; and when at length learningrevived in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a large portionof those long-hoarded volumes flowed into the collections of themunificent founders of libraries, and there, having become known to thelearned, they were speedily consigned to the immortal custody of thepress.The places in which these remains of ancient literature had beenpreserved, during the middle ages, were too many, and they were toodistant from each other, and they were too little connected by any kindof intercourse, to admit of a combination or conspiracy having for itsobject any supposed purposes of interpolation or corruption. Possessingtherefore as we do, in most cases, copies of the same author, some ofwhich were drawn from the monasteries of England, others from those ofSpain, and others collected in Egypt, Palestine, or Asia Minor, if, oncomparing them, we find that they agree, except in variations of littlemoment, we have an incontestable proof of the care and integrity withwhich the business of transcription had generally been conducted. Forit is evident that if the practice of mutilation, interpolation, andcorruption, had to any considerable extent been admitted, the existingremains of ancient authors, after so long a time, would have retainedscarcely a trace of integrity or uniformity. A licentious practice oftranscription, operating through the course of a thousand or fifteenhundred years, must have resulted, not in giving us the connected andconsistent works we actually possess, but only a heterogeneous mass ofmangled fragments.But now, if the general accordance of existing manuscripts attests theprevailing care, and even the scrupulousness of those through whosehands they passed, the peculiar nature of the diversities that do existamong the several copies of the same author, serves to establish a factwhich, if we did not know it by other means, it would be of the highestimportance to prove: namely, that these works _had already descendedthrough a long course of time, when the existing copies were executed_.This fact is especially apparent in the case of the earlier Greekauthors; for while some copies retain uniformly the peculiarities ofthe dialect in which the author wrote; in others, these peculiaritiesare merged in those more common forms of the language which prevailedafter the time of the decline of the Greek literature. These deviationsin orthography, or in construction, from the author’s text, wereevidently made by successive copyists in compliance with the tastesof purchasers of books in different countries; nor were they likelyto have been effected by transcribers of _the middle ages_, whenthese books were no longer in use by readers to whom the language wasvernacular, and to whom, alone, an accordance with the colloquial formsof the language could be a matter of any importance.Books in a dead language, and which can be intended for the use of thelearned only, will never be accommodated to the colloquial fashions ofan intermediate period. Let us consider how it would be in an instancefamiliar to us. If, for example, in examining two editions of thepoems of Chaucer, one of them should be found to retain the originalpeculiarities of orthography, proper to the author’s time, while, inthe other, those peculiarities are all softened down into the formsadopted in the reign of Elizabeth, we should certainly attribute theedition to _that_ period rather than suppose the corrections to havebeen made by a modern editor.Again:--some copies of ancient authors present instances in which,when a passage is compared with the same in another copy, it is easyto perceive that an early transcriber, having fallen into an error,more than one succeeding transcriber has attempted a restoration of thegenuine reading; for the _last_ conjectural emendation has plainly beenframed out of two or three prior corrections.Thus it is, then, that the existing manuscripts of the classic authorsmay be traced up, either by direct evidence, or by unquestionableinferences, very near to the age--and, in many instances--quiteup to the age when these works were universally diffused, werefamiliarly known, and were incessantly quoted by other writers; andwhen, therefore, the history of each work may easily and abundantlybe collected from the testimony of contemporary and succeedingauthors. The various facts, above alluded to, serve to connect theliterary remains of antiquity--now in our hands, with the periodof their pristine existence:--we traverse the long era of generalignorance--that wide gulf which separates the intelligence andcivilization of antiquity from the intelligence and civilization ofmodern times, and we land, as it were, upon the native soil of thesemonuments of Mind, and we once more find ourselves surrounded by thatabundance of evidence which belongs to an advanced state of knowledge.We need not wish to trace the history of _manuscripts_ further, than tothe confines of that former world of learning and refinement.Indeed we need not be solicitous to trace the history of these literaryrelics a step further than fairly into the midst of the dark ages.For even if all external and correlative evidence were wanting, and ifnothing were known concerning the classic authors except this--that,such as they now are, they were extant in the tenth century, more thanenough would be known to make it abundantly certain that these workswere the product of a very different, and of a distant age. The men ofthose times might indeed have been the transcribers and conservators,and perhaps even the admirers, of Thucydides, of Xenophon, ofAristophanes, of Plato, of Virgil, of Cicero, of Horace, and ofTacitus; but assuredly they were not the _authors_ of books, such asthose which bear these names. The living pictures of energy, and ofwisdom, and of liberty, which these monuments of taste and geniuscontain, could never have been imagined in the cells of a monastery,nor composed in an age when little was to be seen abroad but ignorance,violence, and slavery; and little found within but a dreamingphilosophy, and a degrading superstition. It is not the prerogative ofthe human mind, however great may be its native powers, to trespass farbeyond the bounds of the scene by which it is immediately surrounded,or to frame images of things which, in their elements, as well as intheir adjuncts, belong to a system and an economy altogether unknown tothe men of that time. To the genius of man it is given to imitate, toselect, to refine, and to exalt; but not to create.       *       *       *       *       *The general import of the facts that have thus been briefly stated,is this, namely, that the books now extant, and which are usuallyattributed to the Greek and Roman writers, have, such as we findthem, descended from a very remote age. But this general affirmationmust always be understood to include an exception of those smalleromissions, additions, and alterations in the text, which have takenplace, either by design, or inadvertency, in the course of oftenrepeated transcriptions.The actual amount and the importance of these corruptions of the textof ancient authors is likely to be overrated by general readers,who seeing that the subject is continually alluded to in criticalworks, and knowing that criticisms upon “various readings” oftenoccupy a space five times exceeding that which is filled by the text,and that not seldom they become the subject of voluminous and angrycontroversies, are led to suppose that questions upon which the learnedare so long and so seriously employed, cannot be otherwise than weightyand substantial. With a view of correcting this impression, so far asit may be erroneous, we shall now briefly explain the general nature,the causes, and the extent of these variations and corruptions.By far the greater proportion of all “various readings”--perhapsnineteen out of twenty, are purely of a _verbal_ kind, and theyare such as can claim the attention of none but philologists andgrammarians: a few may deserve the notice of every reader of ancientliterature; and a few demand the consideration of the student ofhistory. But, taken in a mass, the light in which they should beregarded is that of their furnishing a significant and conclusiveproof of the care, fidelity, and exactness with which the businessof copying was ordinarily conducted. For it is certain that nothingless than a high degree, as well of technical correctness, as ofprofessional integrity, on the part of those who practised this craft,could have conveyed the text of ancient authors through a period--insome instances--of two thousand years, with alterations so trivial asare those which, for the most part, are found actually to have takenplace.When the discrepancies of manuscripts of an author are such asmaterially to affect the sense of a passage in itself important, so asto demand the exercise of discrimination on the part of the studentof history, it becomes necessary to understand, and to bear in mind,what were probably the most common sources of such diversities. Thefollowing may be named as the most common causes of the variousreadings which are met with in comparing several copies of the sameancient author.1. Nothing can be more probable than that authors who long survivedthe first publication of their works, should, from time to time,issue revised copies of them; and each of these altered copies would,if the work were in continual request, and were widely diffused,become the parent, as we may say, of _a family_ of copies. Thus itwould be that, without any fault on the part of the transcribers,a considerable amount of such diversities would be originated, andperpetuated. A large proportion, perhaps, of those variations whichoccupy the diligence and acumen of editors and critics, and for therectification of which so many learned conjectures are often hazarded,have, in fact, arisen from the author’s own hand in revising the copieswhich, at intervals, he delivered to his amanuenses. The perpetualopportunity afforded for introducing corrections, when a book wascontinually in request, would not fail to encourage, in fastidiousauthors, the habit of frequent revision: meantime transcribers, indistant countries, might have no opportunity to collate the earlierwith the later exemplars. This source of various readings seems to havebeen too little adverted to by critics; though it might serve to solvesome perplexing questions relative to the genuineness of particularexpressions or sentences, which have fallen under suspicion from theirnon-existence in certain manuscripts.2. Some errors would, of course, arise from the mere inattention,carelessness, or the ignorance of transcribers; and yet fewer,probably, than may at first be imagined; for besides that thosewho spent their lives in this occupation would generally acquire ahigh degree of technical accuracy of eye, ear, and hand, and thatcorrectness and legibility must have been the qualities upon which,principally, the marketable value of books depended; it is known thatin the monasteries, from whence the greater part of all existingmanuscripts proceeded, there were persons, qualified by their superiorlearning for the task, whose office it was to revise every book thatissued from the Scriptorium. Errors of inadvertency must, nevertheless,have occurred. If the author to be transcribed was read by one person,while several wrote from his voice, the process would be open, notonly to the mistakes of the reader’s eye, and to those of the writer’shand; but especially to those of the writer’s ear; for words, similarin sound, might often be substituted, one for the other. Instances ofthis sort are of frequent occurrence, and the knowledge of the probablecause often serves to suggest the proper correction. If the writer readfor himself, he would be liable to mistake letters of similar shape--tomistake the _sense_ by a wrong division of words in his manner ofreading, in consequence of which he might involuntarily accommodate theorthography or the syntax to the supposed sense. The frequent use ofcontractions in writing was a very common source of errors; for many ofthese abbreviations were extremely complicated, obscure, and ambiguous,so that an unskilful copyist was very likely to mistake one word foranother. No parts of ancient books have suffered so much from errorsof inadvertency as those which relate to _numbers_; for as one numeralletter was easily mistaken for another, and as neither the sense ofthe passage, nor the rules of orthography, nor of syntax, suggestedthe genuine reading, when once an error had arisen, it would mostoften be perpetuated, without remedy. It is, therefore, almost alwaysunsafe to rest the stress of an argument upon any statement of numbersin ancient writers, unless some correlative computation confirms thereading of the text. Hence nothing can be more frivolous or unfair thanto raise an objection against the veracity or accuracy of an historian,upon some apparent incompatibility in his statement of numbers.Difficulties of this sort it is much better to attribute, at once, to acorruption of the text, than to discuss them with ill-spent assiduity.3. The assumption of short marginal notes into the text, appears tohave been a frequent source of various readings. When such notessupplied ellipses in the author’s language, or when they conduced muchto the perspicuity of an obscure passage, the copyist would be verylikely to incorporate the exegetical phrase, rather than that it shouldeither be lost to the reader, or should deform the margin.4. Transcribers frequently thought themselves free to substitute modernfor obsolete words or phrases; and sometimes they consulted the wishesof their customers, by exchanging the forms of one dialect (of theGreek) for those of another; or, more often, for the common forms ofthe language. Alterations of this kind have often been the occasion ofbringing authentic works under needless suspicion; for when the texthas contained words or phrases which are known to belong to a later agethan that of the supposed author, such incongruities have seemed toafford proofs of spuriousness.5. Intentional omissions, interpolations, or alterations, wereunquestionably sometimes ventured on by transcribers. But so many arethe means we possess for detecting any such wilful corruptions--drawnfrom a comparison of different manuscripts, or from the incongruityof the interpolated passage, that there is perhaps, altogether, moreprobability that, from some accidental peculiarity of style, genuinepassages of ancient authors should fall under suspicion, than thatany actually spurious portions should entirely escape suspicion anddetection.Of the above-mentioned sources of the various readings found in thetext of ancient authors, it should be remembered that the operation ofthe _first_ was confined to the short term of the author’s life; norindeed, whatever may be the amount or importance of variations arisingfrom _this_ source, must they go to swell the number of _corruptions_of the text. The _second_ source of variations was indeed open duringthe lapse of many centuries; yet it has always been held in check bythe diligent collation of copies, on the part of industrious critics,from age to age: and a large proportion of errors, arising from mereinadvertency, are either so palpable as to suggest the means of theirown correction; or they are so trivial as to merit no attention,except from those who charge themselves with the responsibilitiesof an editor. There is, besides, reason to believe that not a fewexisting copies of the most celebrated authors, present a text that haspassed through the process of transcription not oftener than once ortwice; and that each time the copy has been executed with scrupulousexactness. Variations arising from the _third_ and _fourth_ sources,have perhaps occasioned to critics and editors more perplexity thanthose springing from any other cause; and yet these differences arerarely of any moment, so far as the sense of the author is concerned:they can be deemed important only when they tend to perplex thequestion of the date or the genuineness of a book. Corruptions of the_fifth_ class must be acknowledged materially to affect the creditand value of ancient literature, so far as there can be any reason tosuspect their existence; and every diligent student of history willthink the investigation of cases of this kind deserving of his utmostattention.CHAPTER III. THE DATE OF ANCIENT WORKS, INFERRED FROM THE QUOTATIONS AND REFERENCES OF CONTEMPORARY AND SUCCEEDING WRITERS.Let us now suppose, that the Greek and Latin authors are extant onlyin the printed editions--that is to say, that every one of the ancientmanuscripts has long since perished, and that the facts that have beenreferred to in the preceding pages are out of our view, or unknown. Ourbusiness then would be, to collect from these works such a series ofmutual references, as should both prove the identity of the works nowextant with those so referred to; and also fix the relative places ofthe several writers in point of time.A single reference, found in one author, to the works of another,who, in his turn, needs the same kind of authentication, may seemto be a fallacious, or insufficient, and obscure kind of proof; forthis reference or this quotation may possibly be an interpolation; orthe reference may be of too slight or indefinite a kind to make itcertain, that the work now extant is the same as that so referred to.In truth, the validity of this kind of proof arises from its _amount_,from its _multifariousness_, and from its _incidental character_. Foralthough a single and solitary testimony may be inconclusive, manyhundred independent testimonies, all bearing upon the same point, aremuch more than sufficient to remove every shadow of doubt; some ofthese references may be slight and indefinite, but others are full,particular, and complete. If some are formal and direct, and suchtherefore as might be supposed to have been inserted with a fraudulentdesign, others are altogether circuitous and purely incidental. If somehave descended to us through the same channels, others are derivedfrom sources as far removed as can be imagined from the possibility ofcollusion.But a work may happen to want this kind of evidence, and yet, onother grounds, it may possess a valid claim to genuineness. In fact,almost all the existing remains of ancient literature are abundantlyauthenticated by the numerous and explicit quotations from them, ordescriptions of them, that occur in other works. And there are very fewbooks that do not contain some direct or some indirect allusions toother works: so it is that the remains of ancient literature, taken asa mass, contains within itself the proof of the authenticity of eachpart.The nature of the case gives to this body of references a pyramidalform. In the most remote age it is, of course, small in amount; inthe next age it becomes much more ample and substantial; and in laterperiods, it spreads itself over the entire surface of literature.The literature of the Greeks was national and original; they borrowedfrom their neighbours less in poetry, philosophy, and history, thanin religion, or the arts: their _early_ writers were not, in themodern sense of the term, men of learning; their works were composedat the impulse of genius, and of the moving spirit of the times. Thehabit of literary allusion and quotation had not then been formed, norindeed was it congruous with this order of intellectual production; andyet the early Greek writers contain mutual references, which, if notnumerous, are sufficient to establish and ascertain, in most instances,the genuineness of each.The second period of Greek literature, dating from the times ofAlexander, and reaching down to the overthrow of the Greek nationalindependence by the Romans, was, in the natural order of things,an era of learning, of criticism, and of imitation. The writers ofthis period, therefore, abound with references of all kinds to theirpredecessors and contemporaries. A second age of literature holds upa mirror of the first. Erudition, amplitude, comprehension, method,labour, take the place of spontaneous effort, and of intuitive taste.Commentators, compilers, and collectors abound; and the writers of suchan age seem to perform the functions of _caryatides_ in the temple oflearning; as if their only business was to sustain the pediment whichchiefly attracts the admiration of spectators. Among writers of thisclass, therefore, we are to look for a copious harvest of quotations;and in their pages we shall rarely fail to meet with evidence bearingupon any question of the genuineness of an ancient writer.The Romans borrowed everything but energy of character and practicalgood sense, from the Greeks. Their literature, from the first, wasof a derived character; their writers added learning to what mightbe their native genius; and their works reflect the literature oftheir masters. Sufficiently ample allusions, therefore, to themost celebrated of the Greek authors, as well as to those of theircountrymen, are found scattered throughout the Latin classics.Both the Greek and Latin writers of later ages were well acquaintedwith the literature of brighter times; and they have left in theirworks ample means for bringing down the chain of references to thetime of the decline of learning in Europe--to that time up to whichwe have already traced the history of existing manuscripts; so thatthe two lines of evidence unite about midway between the fifth and thefifteenth centuries.The nature, extent, and validity of the evidence that may be derivedfrom the mutual references of authors, will be best exhibited by aclassification of its several kinds under the following heads:--1. Literal quotations, whether the author cited is named or not.Such quotations serve the double purpose of proving the existence ofthe work quoted in the time of the writer who makes the reference,and of identifying, and sometimes even of correcting, the extanttext. If, for example, in subsequent writers, we find only a dozenor twenty sentences, taken from different parts of an earlier work,the verbal coincidence is sufficient to prove that the work, such aswe now find it, is the same as that quoted. When such quotations arenumerous and exact, they afford the best means, either of restoringthe genuine reading of authors, or of judging of the comparativepurity of different manuscripts. For frequently these quotations seemto have suffered less in the course of transcription than either theother parts of the work in which they are found, or than that fromwhich they are taken. The reason of this difference may readily beimagined:--either the author himself quoted from a copy purer thanany that are now extant; or the transcriber, meeting with a passagewhich he remembered to belong to a well-known work, consulted theoriginal, of which he had a good copy, and the very circumstance ofdoing so would naturally induce somewhat more of care than in ordinarytranscription.2. Incidental allusions are often met with, either to the words or tothe sense of an author, sufficiently obvious to prove that the onewriter was known to the other; and yet they are too incidental andremote to be regarded as an interpolation. In questions of apparentdifficulty, such accidental references may be conclusive in proofof the existence of a work at a certain time. Among the ancienthistorians, there are instances in which two writers, who do notmention each other, narrate the same facts with so many coincidences ofmethod, or of details, embellishments, or reflections, as to make itcertain either that both narratives were derived from the same source;or that the one was copied from the other. And if the one narrativehas altogether the air of originality, and is in accordance with thewriter’s style and spirit, the other writer must be held to be thequoting party, and therefore he establishes the prior existence of thework from which he has borrowed.3. Nearly every one of the principal authors of antiquity has beenexplicitly mentioned, or criticised, or described, by later writers.Lists of their works have been given, with summaries of their contents;or they have been made the subjects of connected commentaries, by meansof which the mass of the original work may be identified, and collated,with existing copies. Books of this secondary class are usually fraughtwith references to the entire circle of literature that was extant inthe writer’s time. There are also extant several works containing thelives of ancient authors, with accurate lists of their works. Thesebiographical pieces, while they have on one hand afforded a securityagainst the production of spurious works, on the other hand have givenoccasion to such attempts; for if some treatise, known to have beenwritten by a celebrated author, was believed to have perished, anopportunity was presented for composing one which should correspondwith the description given of it. But such spurious works must alwaysbe deficient in positive evidence, nor will they fail to betray theimposition by some glaring inconsistencies in style, or in matter.The lives of statesmen and warriors often contain such allusions tothe writers of the same age, as suffice to prove the time when theyflourished. All the information we possess on this head is, in manyinstances, derived from allusions of this sort.4. A copious fund of quotations is contained in some ancient treatiseson particular subjects, in which all the authors who have handled thesame topic are mentioned in the order of time.5. Controversies, whether literary, political, or religious, haveusually occasioned extensive quotations to be made from works of allclasses; and, on the spur of an acrimonious disputation, many obscurefacts have been adduced, which, by some circuitous connexion with otherfacts, have served to determine questions of literary history.6. Among all the means for ascertaining the antiquity and genuinenessof ancient books, none are more satisfactory or more complete thanthose afforded by the existence of early translations. Indeed, ifsuch translations can be proved to have been made near to the time atwhich the author of the original work is believed to have lived, andif they correspond, in the main, with the existing text--and if theyhave descended to modern times through channels altogether independentof those which have conveyed the original work--and if, moreover,ancient translations of the same work, in _several languages_, are inexistence, no kind of proof can be more perfect, or more trustworthy.In such cases every other evidence might safely be dispensed with.Ancient translations serve also the important purpose of furnishing acriterion by which to judge of the comparative merits of manuscripts,and by which also to determine questions of suspected interpolation.Although the genuineness of by far the greater part of ancientliterature is established by a redundancy of testimonies, such as thosehere described, there will of course be some few instances of workswhich, though probably genuine, are so destitute of external proof thatthey must remain under doubt; and there are also some few which, thoughprobably spurious, possess just so much plausible proof of genuinenessas serves to maintain a place for them on the ground of controversy.The two together, therefore, will yield some number of disputablecases. The controversies that have actually been carried on relativeto such doubtful works have served to show the exceedingly smallchance which any actually spurious work can have of escaping suspicionand detection. And thus these discussions furnish, implicitly, thestrongest grounds for relying upon the genuineness of those worksagainst which even a captious and whimsical scepticism can maintain noplausible objection.CHAPTER IV. THE ANTIQUITY AND GENUINENESS OF ANCIENT BOOKS MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE HISTORY OF THE LANGUAGES IN WHICH THEY ARE EXTANT.A language is at once the most complete, and it is the least fallibleof all historical records. A poem or a history may have been forged;but a language is an unquestionable reality. The bare circumstanceof its existence, though it may long have ceased to be colloquiallyextant, proves, in substance, what it is which history has tocommunicate. If we did but possess a complete vocabulary of an ancientlanguage, and if we were to digest the mass in accordance with an exactprinciple of synthesis, we should frame a model of the people that onceused it--a model more perfect than any other monuments can furnish:and on this ground we need fear no falsifications, no concealments, noflatteries, no exaggerations. The precise extent of knowledge and ofcivilisation to which a people attained--nothing more and nothing less,is marked out in the mass of words of which they were accustomed tomake use.A language, if the comparison may be admitted, might be called a_cast_ of the people who spoke it--a cast, taken from the very life;and it is one which represents the world of mind, as well as theworld of matter. The common objects of nature--the peculiarities ofclimate--the works of art--the details of domestic life--politicalinstitutions--religious opinions and observances--philosophy,poetry, and art--every form and hue of the external world, and everymodification of thought, find their representatives in the language ofthe people.In any case, therefore, if we have a complete knowledge of alanguage--that is to say, of the words of which it consists--we possessa mass of facts by aid of which to judge of the claims to authenticityof every work in which that language is embodied. And if, in additionto a knowledge of its vocabulary, the laws of its construction also,and the nicest proprieties of its syntax and style are known; and if,moreover, the changes that have taken place from age to age in thesense of words, and in modes of expression, are understood, we thenpossess ample and exact _data_ with which to compare any book thatpretends to antiquity. A writer who employs his native language mustbe expected to conform himself to its usages; and we should find himadhering, more or less strictly, to the peculiarities of the age inwhich he writes: his vocabulary, moreover, will include that compass ofwords which his subject demands, and which the language affords.It is true that such a degree of skill in a dead language may beacquired as may enable a writer to use it with so exact a proprietyas shall deceive, or at least perplex, even the most accomplishedscholars. But the difficulty of avoiding every phrase of later origin,and all modern senses of those words which are continually passingfrom a literal to a metaphorical meaning, is so great, as to leave thechances of escaping detection extremely small. Yet, as such a chancestill remains within the range of possibility, this line of evidencecannot be reckoned absolutely conclusive, but must only be employedas subsidiary to those other evidences that bear upon questions ofauthenticity.The minute changes which are continually taking place in mostlanguages, and the history of which, when known, serves often toascertain the date of ancient books, are of two kinds; namely, thosewhich result necessarily from actual changes in the objects representedby words, and those which are mere changes in the use and proprietiesof language itself.Language being a mirror, reflecting all the communicable notions ofthe people who use it, every mutation in the condition of the peoplemust bring with it, either new terms, or new combinations of words;and as the particular circumstances which introduce such additions oralterations are often known, their occurrence in an author may serve tofix the date of the book, almost with certainty.Moreover, there is a progression in language itself, independent of anyalterations in the objects represented by words. Whenever a vocabularyaffords a choice of appellatives, even for immutable objects ornotions, the caprices of conversation or of literature--affectationperhaps, or excessive refinement, will, from time to time, occasion anew selection to be made. In all those terms, especially, which eitherbring with them ideas too familiar to accord with the proprieties of anelevated style, or which are in any degree offensive to delicacy, therewill take place a continual, and, sometimes, even a rapid, substitutionof new for old phrases--not because the new are in themselves moredignified, or more pure than the old; but because, when firstintroduced, they are untainted by gross associations or vulgar use.Every language, therefore, copious specimens of which are extant, andof which the progress is known, contains a latent history of the peoplethrough whose lips it has passed, and furnishes to the scholar a seriesof recondite dates, by means of which literary remains may almost withcertainty be assigned to their proper age. This sort of evidence bearsthe same relation to the history of _books_, which that derived fromthe successive changes known to have taken place in the mode of writingbears to the history of _manuscripts_. It is of a subsidiary kind, andfrom its very indirectness it often deserves peculiar attention.We have now seen on what grounds it is, generally, that with reasonableconfidence the extant works of ancient authors may be accepted asbeing such in truth. In presenting this statement of the case, nothingmore has been attempted than to offer an outline or brief summary ofthe argument before us. Certain parts of this argument, as the readerwill at once perceive, would admit of much amplification; and in anyinstance in which the genuineness of a particular manuscript, or theauthenticity of an ancient work were alleged to be questionable, everypart of the evidence would require to be brought forward in all itsdetails, and to be narrowly scrutinized.CHAPTER V.ANCIENT METHODS OF WRITING, AND THE MATERIALS OF BOOKS.As our present inquiry relates to _Books_, it will not be expected toinclude anything concerning ancient methods of engraving inscriptionsupon marbles, metals, or precious stones. Yet it should be rememberedthat a knowledge of inscriptions is often highly important, asfurnishing subsidiary and independent means of determining the ageof manuscripts, as indicated by the character of the writing. For asthere are extant almost innumerable specimens of writing upon the moredurable materials, and as these specimens belong to every age from thevery earliest times, and as such inscriptions usually contain, eitheran explicit date, or some allusion to public persons or events, theyserve to determine, beyond doubt, the successive changes that havetaken place in the form of letters, and in the modes of writing.MATERIALS OF ANCIENT BOOKS.No material for books has, perhaps, a higher claim to antiquity thanthe skin of the calf or goat, tanned soft, and which usually wasdyed red or yellow: the skins, when thus prepared, were most oftenconnected in lengths, sometimes of a hundred feet, sufficient tocontain an entire work; or one _book_ of a history or treatise, whichthen formed a roll, or _volume_. These soft skins seem to have beenmore in use among the Jews and other Asiatics than among the people ofEurope. The copies of the Hebrew Scriptures, found in the synagogues ofthe Jews, are often of this kind: the most ancient manuscripts extantare some copies of the Pentateuch, on rolls of crimson leather.Parchment--Pergamena, so called long after the time of its first use,from Pergamus, a city of Mysia, where the manufacture was improved andcarried on to a great extent, is mentioned by Herodotus and Ctesias,as a material which had been from time immemorial used for books. Ithas proved itself to be, of all others, except that above mentioned,the most durable. The greater part of all those manuscripts, now inour hands, that are of higher antiquity than the sixth century, are onparchment; as well as, generally, all carefully written, and curiouslydecorated manuscripts, of later times. The palimpsests, mentioned in apreceding chapter, are usually parchments.The practice, which is still followed in the East, of writing upon theleaves of trees, is of great antiquity. The leaves of the mallow, orof the palm, were those the most used for this purpose; sometimes theywere wrought together so as to form larger surfaces; but it is probablethat so fragile and inconvenient a material was employed rather forordinary purposes of business, letter-writing, and the instruction ofchildren, than for books, intended for preservation.The inner bark of the linden or teil tree, and perhaps of some others,called by the Romans _Liber_, by the Greeks _Biblos_, was so generallyused as a material for writing, as to have given its name to _a book_,in both languages. Tables of solid wood called _codices_--whence theterm _codex_, for a manuscript, on any material, has passed into commonuse--were also employed; but this was chiefly for legal documents,on which account a system of laws came to be called--a Code. Leavesor tablets of lead, or of ivory, are frequently mentioned by ancientauthors as in common use for writing. But no material or preparationseems to have been so frequently employed, on ordinary occasions,as tablets covered with a thin coat of coloured wax, which might bereadily removed by an iron needle, called a _style_; and from which thewriting was as easily effaced, by applying the blunt end of the sameinstrument.But during many ages the article most in use, and of which theconsumption was so great as to form a principal branch of the commerceof the Mediterranean, was that which was manufactured from the papyrusof Egypt. Many manuscripts written upon this kind of paper in thesixth, and some even so early as the fourth century, are still extant.It formed the material of by far the larger proportion of all booksfrom very early times till about the seventh or eighth century, when itgradually gave place to a still more convenient manufacture--our modernpaper.The papyrus, or reed of Egypt, grew in vast quantities in the stagnantpools that were formed by the annual inundations of the Nile. Theplant consists of a single stem, rising sometimes to the height often cubits: this stem, gradually tapering from the root, supports aspreading tuft at its summit. The substance of the stem is fibrous,and the pith contains a sweet juice. Every part of this plant wasput to some use by the Egyptians--so ingenious and so industrious asthey were. The harder and lower part they formed into cups and otherutensils; the upper part into staves, or the ribs of boats: the sweetpith was a common article of food; while the fibrous part of the stemwas manufactured into cloth, sails for ships, ropes, strings, shoes,baskets, wicks for lamps, and, especially, into paper. For this purposethe fibrous coats of the plant were peeled off, throughout the wholelength of the stem. One layer of fibres was then laid across anotherupon a block, and being moistened, the glutinous juice of the plantformed a cement, sufficiently strong to give coherence to the fibres;when greater solidity was required, a size made from bread or glue wasemployed. The two films being thus connected, were pressed, dried inthe sun, beaten with a broad mallet, and then polished with a shell.This texture was cut into various sizes, according to the use for whichit was intended, varying from thirteen, to four fingers’ breadth, andof proportionate length.By progressive improvements, which were made especially when themanufacture came into the hands of the Roman artists, this Egyptianpaper was at length brought to a high degree of perfection. In laterages it was made of considerable thickness--perfect whiteness, andan entire continuity and smoothness of surface. Nevertheless, itwas, at the best, so friable, that when durability was required, thecopyists inserted a page of parchment between every five or six pagesof the papyrus. Thus the firmness of the one substance defended thebrittleness of the other; and great numbers of books, constituted inthis manner, have resisted the accidents and decays of twelve centuries.Three hundred years before the Christian era, the commerce in thepaper of Egypt had extended over most parts of the civilised world;and long afterwards it continued to be a principal source of wealth tothe Egyptians. But at length the invention of another material, andalso that interruption of commerce which ensued in consequence of theconquest of Egypt by the Saracens, banished the Egyptian paper fromcommon use. Comparatively few manuscripts on this material are found oflater date than the eighth or ninth century; although it continued tobe occasionally used long afterwards.The charta bombycina, or cotton paper, which has often improperly beencalled _silk_ paper, had unquestionably been manufactured in the Eastas early as the ninth century, and probably much earlier; and in thetenth century it came into general use throughout Europe. Not longafterwards, this invention was made still more available for generalpurposes by the substitution of old linen, or cotton rags, for the rawmaterial; for by this means both the price of the article was reduced,and its quality greatly improved. The cotton paper manufactured in theancient mode is still used in the East, and is a beautiful fabric; itis also extensively used in the United States.From this account of the materials successively employed for books, itwill be obvious, that a knowledge of the changes which these severalmanufactures underwent from age to age, will often make it easy, andespecially when employed in subservience to other evidence, to fixwith certainty the date of manuscripts; or at the least, to furnishinfallible means for detecting fabricated documents.The preservation of books, framed as they are of materials sodestructible, through a period of twelve, or even fifteen hundredyears, is a fact which might seem almost incredible; especially soas the decay of far more durable substances, within a much shorterperiod, is continually presented to our notice. Yet so it is, thatwhile the massive walls of the monasteries of the middle ages are oftenseen prostrate, and their materials fast mingling with the soil, themanuscripts, penned within them, or perhaps at a time when these stoneswere yet in the quarry, are still fair and perfect, and glitter withtheir gold and silver, their cerulean and their cinnabar.It must be remembered, however, that the materials of books, althoughdestructible, are so far from being in themselves perishable, thatso long as they are defended from positive injuries, they appear tosuffer scarcely at all from any intrinsic principle of decay, or tobe liable to any perceptible process of chemical decomposition. Noone, says Mabillon, unless totally unacquainted with what relates toantiquity, can call in question the great durability of parchments;since there are extant innumerable books, written on that material,in the seventh and sixth centuries; and some of a still more remoteantiquity, by which all doubt on that subject might be removed. Itmay suffice here to mention the Virgil of the Vatican Library, whichappears to be of more ancient date than the fourth century; and anotherin the King’s Library little less ancient: also the Prudentius, inthe same library, of equal age; to which you may add several, alreadymentioned, as the Psalter of S. Germanus, the Book of the Councils, andothers, which are all of parchment.The paper of Egypt, being more frail and brittle, might be open togreater doubt; and yet there are books of great antiquity, by which itsdurability may be established.Books have owed their conservation, not merely to the durability of thematerial of which they were formed; but to the peculiarity of theirbeing, at once precious, and yet (in periods of general ignorance) notmarketable articles; they were of inestimable value to a few, whileabsolutely worthless in the opinion of the multitude. They were alsooften indebted for their preservation, in periods of disorder andviolence, to the sacredness of the roofs under which they were lodged.THE INSTRUMENTS OF WRITING, AND INKS.The instruments used for writing would, of course, be such as wereadapted to the material on which they were to be employed. For writingupon the brazen, leaden, or waxed tablets, above mentioned, a needle,called a style, was used, the upper end of which, being smooth andflat, served to obliterate the marks on the tablet, as occasion mightrequire. These styles were at first most often formed of iron or brass;but afterwards of ivory, bone, or wood. Indeed a fatal use having been,on several occasions, made of these pointed weapons by angry partisansin the public courts, the use of iron styles was prohibited; Cæsar,when attacked by the conspirators, is said to have used his iron styleas a dagger, and with it to have pierced the arm of one of them: andthe story of the Christian schoolmaster, Cassianus, is well known, whois said to have been killed by his scholars, armed with their styles:other similar instances are recorded.For the purpose of writing with fluid ink, a calamus, formed generallyfrom a reed of the Nile, was used. Persons of distinction often wrotewith a calamus of silver. The use of quills seems to have been ofancient date; but long after the time when the fitness of the quill forthe purpose of writing had become known, the calamus of reed continuedto be preferred. The scalpel, or knife employed for trimming the pen,the compasses, for measuring the distances of the lines, and thescissars, for cutting the paper, are always seen on the desk of thewriters in the decorations attached to many ancient manuscripts.The ink most used by the ancients has been said, but on ratheruncertain authority, to have consisted of the black liquor found inthe cuttle fish. But it has been proved by chemical analysis that anopaque ink, very different from the mere dye or stain used at present,was commonly employed by the transcribers of books. This opaque inkseems, like the China ink, to have been formed from the finest soot oflamps, in which the purest combustibles were burnt. The coal of ivory,or of the finer woods, powdered, was also in use; these or similarsubstances, mixed with gums, and diluted with acids, formed a pigmentthat was much more durable than our modern ink; but it was also farless fluent, and therefore less adapted to a rapid and continuousmovement of the pen.The ink, says Montfaucon, which we see in the most ancient Greekmanuscripts, has evidently lost much of its pristine blackness; yetneither has it become altogether yellow or faint, but is rather tawnyor deep red, and often is not far from a vermilion. This appears inmany manuscripts of the fourth and following centuries. Yet there aresome written with an ink more skilfully composed, which have preservedtheir first blackness. It has happened also, when the surface of theparchment, instead of being polished, was spongy, that the ink hasbecome yellow. In all the bombycine manuscripts, owing to the natureof the material, a separation of the parts of the ink has takenplace; the grosser part standing on the surface, while the finer haspenetrated the substance of the paper.Inks of various colours, especially red, purple, and blue, and alsogold and silver inks, were much used by the ancients: few manuscriptsare destitute of some such ornamental diversities of colour; and manyare splendidly recommended to the eye by these means. There was apurple ink, which was appropriated to the use of the emperors, andwas called the sacred encaustic; but a dye, not easily distinguishedfrom that which appears upon some imperial charters, is very commonlyfound in ancient books. And it is said that they must have had a nicesight who could so distinguish between the two as to have detected aviolation of the law on this subject. The subscription commonly seen atthe end of Greek manuscripts, containing the name of the transcriber,with the year, month, day, indiction, and sometimes the hour when thecopy was finished, are most often written in the imperial colour,especially in the times of the lower empire; or if not in that ink, inone that cannot now be distinguished from it.The titles of chapters were frequently written alternately in red andcerulean: marginal notes, most often in the latter colour. Books of alater date often have all the capitals of a bright green. The Greeks,more frequently than the Romans, used golden ink; and many Greekmanuscripts are extant in which, not the titles and capitals only,but whole pages, are elegantly written in a pigment of the preciousmetals: but it was rather upon ecclesiastical than profane literaturethat this honour was bestowed. The works of the Fathers, chiefly, wereso adorned, and sometimes the Gospels: there is extant a copy of thefour Evangelists, written upon purple parchment, in letters of goldthroughout. The practice of using gold and silver inks was so common,that the manufacture of them became a distinct business; and thosewho were skilled in this sort of writing seldom followed any otheremployment than that of inserting the titles, capitals, or emphaticwords, in copies that had been executed by inferior hands. Severalcurious recipes for the preparation of the precious pigments are givenby the later Greek waiters.Those who have been long accustomed to inspect and examine ancientmanuscripts acquire a certain tact in judging of the age of a book fromthe condition of the ink, its colour and composition, which cannot beexplained to others, and for the exercise of which no rules can belaid down. But in cases where a fraud is suspected, this nice habitof the eye often detects at once the imposition. It is perhaps morepracticable to give to a picture, than to a manuscript, the hue ofantiquity by artificial means.CHAPTER VI. CHANGES INTRODUCED IN THE COURSE OF TIME IN THE FORMS OF LETTERS, AND IN THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF WRITING.An exact uniformity in the shapes of letters, and in the generalappearance of writing, is hardly maintained for so long a period asfifty years in any language, especially if it be widely diffused.Within that space of time, the fashion of our own typography hasundergone several changes, so perceptible as to afford a tolerablycertain criterion of the date of books. No person, for example, who isfamiliar with books, would find it difficult, merely from the characterof the type, to discriminate the age of works published at the severalperiods of 1775, 1800, 1825, and 1855. On similar grounds a knowledgeof the successive changes introduced by caprice, accident, or a regardto convenience, in the ancient modes of writing, affords an almostcertain means of determining the age of manuscripts.The knowledge requisite for the exercise of this discrimination isderived, in part, from incidental allusions to modes of writing whichoccur in some ancient authors; but principally from an extensivecomparison of manuscripts themselves, and from a comparison ofmanuscripts with inscriptions upon marbles, brazen tablets, or coins.From these sources may be collected a sufficiently precise idea of thecharacter or fashion of writing prevailing in each century, from thesecond, to the fifteenth, of the Christian era.The oldest Greek manuscripts that are extant differ little in theform of the letters, or the general appearance of the writing, frominscriptions belonging to the corresponding periods. They are writtenin capitals, called uncials, without division of words, and withoutmarks of accentuation or punctuation. About the seventh century, thecustom of affixing the accents and aspirates appears to have beenintroduced; at the same time a greater degree of precision was observedin the formation of the letters, and also in the directness and theparallelism of the lines. To these improvements was added a change inthe form of those letters which most impeded the rapid movement of thepen.In the eighth and ninth centuries a mode of writing, which had beenlong before practised by notaries and by the secretaries of publicpersons, was adopted by the transcribers of books. This was a kind ofrunning-hand, those who invented, or who most used it, being calledtachygraphoi--swift writers. To adapt the Greek letters to the purposeof public business and common life, the square forms had been changedfor curves, and uprights for slopes: and while a radical resemblanceto the primitive character was preserved, facility and freedom wereobtained.The uncial character was not, however, altogether abandoned by thecopyists; but modifications of it were introduced with a view to obtaingreater facility: for the unconnected and upright squares formerlyused, seemed still more operose in execution after the running-handhad been adopted. The copyists of the eighth century introduced thepractice of commencing books or chapters with a letter of large size,which they usually distinguished by grotesque decorations, somewhat inthe manner seen in the printed books of the sixteenth century.Those who gained their living by copying books found so great anadvantage in the adoption of the swift, or tachygraphic character,that they presently sought to improve it by every device that mightfavour the uninterrupted movement of the pen; not content with joiningthe letters of each word, they combined them in forms that often borelittle or no resemblance to the component characters. The books ofthe tenth and following centuries abound with these contractions,abbreviations, and symbols. Many entire words of common occurrencewere indicated by single turns of the pen. A great part of thesecontractions were adopted by the first printers, and many of themcontinued in use until a very recent date.The manuscripts of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries aredistinguished by a degeneracy in the mode of writing, and by a growingabuse of the principle of celerity and facility. To these symptomsof the influence of a mercantile motive, put into activity by anincreasing demand for books, may be added the practice of dischargingthe writing of old parchments, which prevailed at the same period moreextensively than heretofore. A vast number of books of this sort,written upon erased parchments, are to be met with, executed in thetwelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries. In most instances, thefirst writing is utterly obliterated; yet the marks of the erasureare still evident. Thus in a MS. above described, not a letter, not apoint, of the ancient writing remains; but on many of the leaves may bediscerned ruled lines, either transverse or perpendicular, which havingbeen deeply impressed upon the parchment could not be effaced; so thatthose old lines often crossed the new writing. Other pages of the sameMS. present no such indications; the leaves having probably been takenfrom different books. In another MS., executed in the year 1186, thoughthe ancient writing is generally obliterated, yet in a few places,if closely inspected, the ends of the letters may be perceived. In aword, if all the books of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries areexamined, there will appear to be almost as many written upon erased,as upon new parchments.[1] I am of opinion, that many authors extant inthe time of Photius, and even in that of Porphyrogenitus, were utterlydestroyed by the prevalence of this pernicious practice. This plague,as it may be termed, spread its devastation among ancient books firstin the twelfth century, and continued its ravages during the thirteenthand fourteenth. The same thing is rarely to be observed in bombycinemanuscripts: I have met with one book only of this material in whichthe first writing had been erased, and a second induced. The Greekwriters of these times ordinarily erased a better work for the sakeof substituting a worse; either one of their own inane productions,or those works of which there is no scarcity among MSS. The extremestignorance must certainly have pervaded Greece in those times, whenwhat related to ancient history, or to polite learning, was not valueda straw by the writers, who rather than purchase new parchment,destroyed, without scruple, ancient books.A progression similar to that which took place in Greek writing,distinguishes manuscripts in the Latin language, and affords a likecriterion of antiquity. Several manuscripts believed, on good evidence,to belong to the third and fourth centuries, are extant, whichpresent a style of writing nearly allied to that which appears in theinscriptions of the same period. But the uncial character gave placeto the small letter at an earlier date among the Roman, than among theGreek copyists; yet they seem to have availed themselves of the changein a much less degree for the purposes of celerity. Indeed, there islittle more of continuity, or of abbreviation in the small, than in thelarge character. Towards the tenth century the Latin scribes adopteda square and heavy character, similar to that which is seen in legaldocuments. This wide and full-faced letter was so much exaggerated bythe writers of the fourteenth century, as almost to blacken the pagewith its massiveness. Still, a handsome regularity and a fair degreeof legibility were maintained. There are, indeed, some manuscripts ofthis period extant which, for mathematical exactness and beauty, mightalmost challenge comparison with printed books.Nothing less, it is obvious, than a long-continued and extensiveexamination of ancient manuscripts, can confer upon any one such adegree of skill in discriminations of this kind, as might warrant hisgiving an opinion in a case of difficulty. Yet the mere inspection of asmall number of these relics of antiquity may convince any one of thereality and distinctness of those progressive changes in the modes ofwriting upon which such discriminations are founded. The architectureof different periods is not more characteristic of the age to whichit belongs, than is the style of writing in manuscripts; nor is thereless certainty in determining questions of antiquity in the one case,than in the other. Particular instances may perplex or deceive thebest-informed and the most acute observers; but the greater number ofcases admit of no question.FORM OF ANCIENT BOOKS, AND THEIR ILLUMINATIONS.The mode of compacting the sheets of their books remained the sameamong the Greeks during a long course of time: little, therefore,pertinent to our argument, is to be gathered on this head. The sheetswere folded three or four together, and separately stitched: theseparcels were then connected nearly in the same mode as is at presentpractised. Books were covered with linen, silk, or leather.Sometimes the page was undivided; sometimes it contained two, and in afew instances of very ancient manuscripts, three columns. A peculiaritywhich attracts the eye in many Greek manuscripts, consists in theoccurrence of capitals on the margin, some way in advance of the lineto which they belong; and this capital sometimes happens to be themiddle letter of a word. For when a sentence finishes in the middle ofa line, the initial of the next is not distinguished, that honour beingconferred upon the incipient letter of the next line; as thus--      THEGREEKSENTERING      THEREGIONOFTHEMA      CRONESFORMEDANAL  T   LIANCEWITHTHEM.AS      HEPLEDGEOFTHEIR      FAITHTHEBARBARIANS      GAVEASPEAR.The Greeks, especially in the earliest times, divided theircompositions into verses; or into such short portions of sentences aswe mark by a comma, each verse occupying a line; and the number ofthese verses is often set down at the beginning or end of a book. Thenumbers of the verses were sometimes placed in the margin.Much intricacy and difficulty attends the subject of ancientpunctuation; nor could any satisfactory account of the rules andexceptions that have been gathered from existing manuscripts begiven, which should subserve the intention of this work. Generallyspeaking, and yet with frequent exceptions, the most ancient bookshave no separation of words, or punctuation, of any kind; others havea separation of words, but no punctuation; in some, every word isseparated from the following one by a point. In manuscripts of laterdate a regular punctuation is found, as well as accentuation. Thesecircumstances enter into the estimate when the antiquity of a book isunder inquiry; but the rules to be observed in considering them cannotbe otherwise than recondite and intricate.Few ancient books are altogether destitute of decorations; and manyare splendidly adorned with pictorial ornaments. These consist eitherof flowery initials, grotesque cyphers, portraits, or even historicalcompositions. Sometimes diagrams, explanatory of the subjects mentionedby the author, are placed on the margin. Books written for the useof royal persons, or of dignified ecclesiastics, usually contain theeffigies of the proprietor, often attended by his family, and by someallegorical or celestial minister; while the humble scribe, in monkishattire, kneels and presents the book to his patron.These illuminations, as they are called, almost always exhibit somecostume of the times, or some peculiarity which serves to mark the ageof the manuscript. Indeed a fund of antiquarian information, relativeto the middle ages, has been collected from this source. Many of thesepictured books exhibit a high degree of executive talent in the artist,although labouring under the restraints of a barbarous taste.FOOTNOTES:[1] Montfaucon.CHAPTER VII.THE COPYISTS; AND THE PRINCIPAL CENTRES OF THE COPYING BUSINESS.It is a matter of some importance to know by what class of persons,chiefly, the business of copying books was practised; and it givesno little support to our confidence in the genuineness of existingmanuscripts, to find that individuals of all ranks, influenced byvery different motives, were accustomed to devote themselves to thisemployment. From the earliest times in which literature flourished,there were, in all the principal cities of Greece and its colonies,great numbers of professional scribes; that is to say, persons whogained their subsistence by copying books. Labourers of this class,it may well be supposed, aimed, in general, at nothing but to gaincustom by the fairness and the fidelity of their copies. But it appearsto have been not uncommon for persons of rank and leisure to occupythemselves in this employment. Thus it is that in the list of copyistswe find the names of the nobles of the Constantinopolitan empire.Some created their libraries for themselves by transcribing everybook that came in their way. To persons of a sedate temper, or who byindisposition were confined to their homes, this occupation may beimagined to have been highly agreeable. Nor was it a wasted labour tothose who had leisure at command; since the high price of books madethe collection of a library, by purchase, scarcely practicable, exceptto the most opulent.The influence of Christianity very greatly extended the practiceof private copying; for motives of piety operated to stimulate theindustry of very many in the good work of multiplying the sacredbooks, and the works of Christian writers. The highest dignitariesof the Church, and princes even, thought themselves well employed intranscribing the Gospels and Epistles, the Psalter, or the homilies ormeditations of the Fathers; nor were the classic authors, as we shallsee, entirely neglected by these gratuitous copyists.But from the third or fourth century downwards, the religious houseswere the chief sources of books, and the monks were almost the onlycopyists. The employment was better suited than any other that canbe imagined, to the rules, and usages, and to the modes of feelingpeculiar to the monastic life. The mental and bodily inertness whichthe spirit and rules of the conventual orders tended to produce, whenconjoined, in individuals, with some measure of native industry,would find precisely a field for that lethargic assiduity which itneeded, in the business of copying books. In many monasteries thisemployment formed the chief occupation of the inmates; and by few wasit altogether neglected.Various appellations occur in the Greek authors, by which the severalorders of writers were designated. Among the scribes or notariesattached to the service of public persons, there were always some whowere eminent for the rapidity with which they wrote, and who thereforebore the title of _tachygraphoi_, or “swift writers.” But those whofollowed the business of copying books, in which legibility was thechief excellence, generally called themselves _kalligraphoi_, or “fairwriters.” Yet these appellations are often used interchangeably.The copyists usually subscribed their names at the end of every book,with the year in which it was executed: to which they often added thename of the reigning emperor; sometimes, though rarely, the name ofthe patriarch of Constantinople, for the time being, is added to thesubscription of the copyist. Manuscripts written in Sicily, bear thename of its kings; those executed in the East, mention the Arabian orTurkish princes. The Greeks of the early ages commonly dated from thecreation of the world, which they placed 5508 years before Christ.Sometimes they reckoned time from the death of Alexander the Great;sometimes from the accession of Philip Aridæus; sometimes from theaccession of Diocletian; and, occasionally, they give some notice ofthe signal events of their times. From these incidental referencesmuch important historical information has often been collected. Thesesignatures are usually written by the hand of the transcriber of thebook.Besides the signature of the copyist, the margins of many manuscriptscontain notes--often very trivial or absurd, from the hands ofsuccessive proprietors of the book; each accompanied with some dateor reference to persons or events, serving to fix the time of theannotator, and, by inference, proving the antiquity of the manuscript.In a few instances the transcribers copied the subscription of thetranscribers of the book from which they wrote; and if that formersubscription bears a date, we have a double indication of antiquity.The fidelity of the copyists, and the genuineness and integrity ofancient manuscripts, have been warmly and learnedly defended by thelaborious Father Mabillon, on every occasion throughout his greatwork, _De Re Diplomatica_.[2] The leading motive which impelled theindefatigable author to the prosecution of the researches of whichthis work gives the result, seems to have been the desire to establishthe genuineness and integrity of ecclesiastical, and especially ofmonastic charters. In the course of his inquiries, he brings forward avast variety and amount of information relating to the modes of writingpractised in the monasteries, and in the courts of the French kings,during the middle ages. These facts are of course most available inarguments that relate to the genuineness and antiquity of existingmanuscripts in the _Latin_ language; but there is so much of thesubstance of the argument touching the genuineness of all ancientwritings in the following passages, that they may well be placedbefore the reader. The work itself is little likely to come under theeye of those for whom this volume is intended.This learned writer says:--“Before I conclude this supplement, Ithink it may be proper to say something concerning the integrity andauthority of ancient books, which some persons dispute. For assuredly,if the genuineness of charters and public deeds is doubted, theauthority of ancient manuscripts in general is also called in question;and, if these doubts can be substantiated, it will appear that thosewho employ themselves in collating the printed editions of the Fathers,or other sacred books, with ancient manuscripts, spend their labour invain. And hence, too, we must believe, contrary to the opinion of alllearned persons, who think the world greatly indebted to the labours ofthe monks in transcribing books, that they toiled to no good purpose.Such persons, to give colour to their opinion, affirm that the existingancient manuscripts were executed by ignorant men, whose blundersare easily perceived by the learned; and on this prejudice they havefounded the decision, that manuscripts having been written, for themost part, by unskilful hands, and derived many from one, are of littleavail in understanding or restoring an author.“But if this principle were admitted, our confidence in the printededitions, as well as in the ancient manuscripts, must fall to theground. Neither the acts of councils, the works of the Fathers, northe Holy Scriptures, would retain any authority. For whence, I ask,proceeded the printed editions, both of profane and sacred writers?were they not derived from ancient manuscripts? If, therefore, theseare of no authority, those can have none; and thus, by this paradoxicalopinion, the foundations, both of literature and of religion, are tornup. And, on this principle, there would be no force in the argumentused by St. Augustine against the Manichæans, who calumniously affirmedevery place of Holy Scripture, by which their errors might be confuted,to be falsified and corrupted. But Augustine, in reply to Faustus,reminds him that whoever had first attempted such a corruption of theScriptures, would have immediately been confuted by a multitude ofancient manuscripts, which were in the hands of all Christians.“On this principle the labours of the Fathers, Jerome, Augustine, andothers, in collating ancient books with modern copies, would have beenfruitless. In vain the appeals of councils to such authorities for thedetermination of controversies; in vain the costs and cares of princesand kings in collecting manuscripts from the remotest countries. Andif the case be thus, the Vatican, the Florentine, the Ambrosian, andthe royal (French) libraries are nothing better than useless heaps ofparchment. And it was to no purpose that the Roman pontiffs and thekings of France, as well as other prelates and princes, sent learnedmen to the farthest parts of the East to obtain ancient books inthe Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and other languages. And then the ancienttranscribers must lose their credit, and especially the monks, whodevoted themselves entirely to the copying of books; such were thedisciples of St. Martin, among whom, according to Sulpicius, no artbut that of writing was practised. For they thought they could not bebetter employed than while at once edifying themselves in the continualperusal of the Holy Scriptures, and spreading the precepts of the Lordfar and wide by their pens. Of this opinion was the pious Guigo: ‘Aswe cannot preach the word with our lips,’ says he, ‘let us do it withour hands; for as many books as we transcribe, so many heralds of thetruth do we send forth.’ And thus also Peter the venerable, writing toGislebert, a recluse, exhorts him to diligence in this exercise: ‘Forso you may become a silent preacher of the Divine Word; and though yourtongue be mute, your hand will speak aloud in the ears of many people.And in future times, after your death, the fruit of your toils willremain, even as long as these books shall endure.’“If it is affirmed that the manuscripts we possess were, for the mostpart, written by unlearned persons; are they therefore undeserving ofregard? In the first place, I deny that they were generally written bythe unlearned. Certainly the blessed martyr Pamphilus, who wrote outthe greater part of the works of Origen, was not unlearned; nor wasJerome unlearned, nor Hilarius. Of Fulgentius, the celebrated bishop(of Ruspa), it is reported that he was famed for his skill in thewriter’s art. The same praise was earned by those holy men Lucianus,Philoromus, and Marcellus; also by the blessed Plato and Theophanus.The blessed Marcella the younger, as says Jerome, wrote quickly andwithout fault. The venerable Bede, Radbert, Raban and others among ourlearned men, discharged the function of copyists, not of their ownworks only, but of those of others.“And even if the greater part of manuscripts were written by unlearnedmen, they are not therefore to be accounted unskilful copyists,provided they read and copied accurately. Experience proves every daythat those compositors are not the most correct who understand Latin,but that such are commonly the most faulty; especially in attempting tocorrect that which they do not properly understand, and which those whoknow nothing of the language set up accurately. But let it be grantedthat the copyists were unlearned: we know that the printed editions arenot derived from a single copy, but from a comparison of many: the mostcareless scribe does not always err, and where he does, his mistakesare amended by the collation of the copies of others.“In a word, there were in all well-ordered churches and monasteries,not only learned writers who transcribed books themselves, but learnedcorrectors, who compared the copies made by others with the originals,and amended whatever was erroneous. A devoted scribe, says Trithemius,when he has carefully written a book, compares it anew with theoriginal, and subjects it to a diligent revision. Many instances mightbe adduced in proof of this revision and correction of manuscripts.One or two may suffice. In the library of the Vatican there is amanuscript written towards the close of the fifth, or in the beginningof the sixth century, containing the books of St. Hilary on theTrinity, which has been collated with an older copy by some studiousperson, as appears by a note at the end. Again, Paul Warnefrid, deaconand monk of Casina, having copied the epistles of Gregory the Great,sent the book to Adalhard, abbot of Corbeia, requesting him to revisethe copy; but the abbot, fearing lest he might alter the genuine textof so learned a doctor, contented himself with placing a mark in themargin at every place where there appeared to him to be an error.“But it is affirmed that there are many faulty, and many falsifiedmanuscripts. That there are not a few faulty books I grant; but thatthere are many falsified manuscripts I stoutly deny. The differencebetween a _faulty_ and a _falsified_ book is essential: of the formersort are those which, from the mistakes or negligence of the writer,contain some blemishes: of the latter kind are those which have beenwilfully corrupted. Many, indeed, may appear to be falsified which arenot so really, nor are even faulty. Which I may thus explain.--It couldnot but happen that the copyists, in transcribing large works, shouldsometimes wander from the true reading--putting perhaps one word foranother. When they observed their error, they might rectify it in twoways, either by erasing the word and inserting the genuine reading; orby inserting the true word beneath the other, which they marked withpoints. Now some persons, not understanding this, or purposely puttingupon it an unfavourable construction, found upon the first case acharge of _erasure_, and in the second, place both words in the text ofthe author, though the pointed word ought to be omitted. Sometimes alsoit happened that words or initials written in vermilion, having grownpale, were renewed by a later hand, which alterations have occasionedan unfounded suspicion of falsification.”The pens of the monastic scribes were chiefly occupied in transcribingreligious books, the Holy Scriptures, the works of the Fathers, thelives of saints, books of meditations and prayers; yet the classicauthors were not neglected. “The Monastery of Pomposia has been muchimproved since the time of its founder Guido [about 1025], renowned forsanctity. Incited by the fame of his piety great numbers assumed thesacred habit in his church; marquesses, counts, and sons of noblemenhave laid aside the pomps and pleasures of the world to follow therethe duties of religion. Among these my master Jerome, afterwardsabbot, was trained up from his earliest years to follow the monasticlife, and made great proficiency in grammar and logic. He, for theedification of the brotherhood, set himself to collect the works oflearned men; in order that amidst the variety, all might meet with theinformation they sought for. Bonus--good--both in name and life, whowas first a hermit and afterwards a monk, was his librarian, a manesteemed by all as a perfect scholar, and so eager in the acquisitionof books that he purchased all he met with, however indistinctly theywere written; for the abbot determined to have them all transcribedfor his library: and by his care almost all are now copied. He is everinquisitive for religious books of all kinds, so that the church ofPomposia is become the most renowned in Italy. Thus by the goodness ofGod our thirst of knowledge is increased by knowing. Indeed the abbot’sdesire of enriching his church with these treasures is unbounded. Butenvious persons may ask, Why does this reverend abbot place the heathenauthors, the histories of tyrants, and such books, among theologicalworks? To this we answer in the words of the apostle, that there arevessels of clay as well as of gold. By these means the tastes of allmen are excited to study--the intention of the gentile writings is thesame as that of the Scriptures, to give us a contempt for the world andsecular greatness.”[3]By these or similar apologies those of the monks, and there were somesuch in most houses, who possessed taste and learning, excused, to themore devout, the attention they bestowed upon the works of the profaneauthors. That the Greek and Latin classics were known and studiedduring what are called the dark ages, is capable of abundant proof, aswe shall presently see. And those whose taste led them to be conversantwith these writings took care, by the labours of their hands, toperpetuate the works they most admired.During the flourishing period of the Grecian republics, that is, fromthe defeat of Xerxes to the time of Alexander the Great, many of theGreek colonies almost equalled, or even surpassed, the mother countryin wealth, refinement, and intelligence. In the neighbouring islands ofthe Ægean Sea--in Asia Minor--in Italy and in Sicily, literature andphilosophy were as eagerly cultivated as at Athens. Many of the mostdistinguished writers and philosophers were natives of the colonies;and if Greece itself was the principal seat of learning, and thefountain head of books, whatever was there produced quickly found itsway to distant settlements; for to every city along the shores of theMediterranean, and of the Euxine, there was a constant exportation ofbooks: in many of these remote cities libraries were collected, and thebusiness of copying was extensively carried on.After the time of Alexander, Grecian literature flourished nowhere soconspicuously as at Alexandria in Egypt, under the auspices of thePtolemies. Here all the sects of philosophy had established themselves;numerous schools were opened; and, for the advancement of learning,a library was collected, which was supposed, at one time, to havecontained 700,000 volumes, in all languages. Connected with the librarythere were extensive offices, in which the business of transcribingbooks was carried on very largely, and with every possible advantagewhich royal munificence on the one hand, and learned assiduity on theother, could insure. Nor did the literary fame of Alexandria declineunder the Roman emperors. Domitian, as Suetonius reports, sent scribesto Alexandria to copy books for the restoration of those librariesthat had been destroyed by fire. And it seems to have been for somecenturies afterwards a common practice for those who wished to form alibrary, to maintain copyists at Alexandria. The conquest of Egypt bythe Saracens, A.D. 640, who burned the Alexandrian Library, banishedlearning for a time from that, as from other countries, which theyoccupied.Attalus, and his successors, the kings of Pergamus, were greatencouragers of learning; and the copying of books was carried on to sogreat an extent in their capital as to occasion the establishment ofa vast manufacture of prepared skins (as mentioned above) which longcontinued to be a considerable article of commerce. The library of thekings of Pergamus is said to have contained 200,000 books.During upwards of a thousand years, from the reign of Constantine untilthe fall of Constantinople, in the fifteenth century, that city wasthe principal seat of learning, and the chief source of books. TheByzantine historians are frequent in their praises of the munificenceof the emperors in purchasing books, and in providing for theirreproduction. The manuscripts executed at Constantinople are oftenremarkable for the great beauty of the writing, and the splendourof the decorations. Besides the imperial libraries, the churchesand monasteries of the city were enriched with collections, more orless extensive, and in all of them the business of transcription wasconstantly and actively pursued.A large number of existing manuscripts are dated from the monasteriesof the country immediately surrounding the metropolis of the easternempire; and many also, from those of Asia Minor, from the islands ofthe Ægean Sea, and especially from Cyprus.But no spot was more famed for the production of books than MountAthos--the lofty promontory which stretches from the Macedonian coastfar into the Ægean Sea. The heights and the sides of this mountainwere almost covered with religious houses, rendered by art and nature,and by the universal opinion of the sanctity of the monks of the “holymountain,” so secure that neither the meditations nor employments ofthe recluses were disturbed by the approach of violence. The chiefoccupation of the inmates of these establishments is affirmed to havebeen the transcription of books, of which each monastery boasted alarge collection.Many extant manuscripts prove that the copying of books was practisedextensively during the middle ages in the monasteries of the Morea, inthose of the islands of Eubœa and of Crete. This latter island seemsindeed to have been a place of refuge for men of learning during thelatter periods of the eastern empire, who found in its monasteries,both shelter, and the means of subsistence.Fifty religious establishments in Calabria, and the kingdom of Naples,are mentioned, from which proceeded a large number of books afterwardscollected in the libraries of Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan.In the monasteries of western Europe also, and especially in those ofthe British Islands, this system of copying was carried on. Thoughthere were considerable diversities in the rules and practices of themonks of different orders, the elements of the monastic life were inall orders and in every country the same; and generally speaking,wherever there were monasteries, there was a manufacture of books.Yet, in some houses, these labours of the pen were much more worthilydirected than in others. For while the monks of one monastery employedthemselves in transcribing missals, legends, or romances, othersenriched their libraries with splendid copies of the fathers of thechurch, and of the Holy Scriptures; and some, though a smaller number,took care to reproduce such of the classic authors as they might beacquainted with.The monastic institution seemed as if it were framed for the specialpurpose of transmitting the remains of ancient literature--sacredand profane, through a period in which, except for so extraordinarya provision, they must inevitably have perished. In every country alarge class of the community--freed from the necessity of labour, andexcluded from active employments, was constrained to seek the meansof allaying the pains of listlessness; and nothing could answer thispurpose so well as the transcription of books. And to this employment,congruous as it was with the physical habits that are induced by aninert mode of life, and compatible, too, with the observance of a roundof unvarying formalities, was attached an opinion of meritoriousness,which served to animate the diligence of the labourer. “This book,copied by M. N. for the benefit of his soul, was finished in the year----, may the Lord think upon him.” Such are the subscriptions of manyof the manuscripts of the middle ages.  Meanwhile along the cloister’s painted side,  The monks--each bending low upon his book  With head on hand reclined--their studies plied;  Forbid to parley, or in front to look,  Lengthways their regulated seats they took:  The strutting prior gazed with pompous mien,  And wakeful tongue, prepared with prompt rebuke,  If monk asleep in sheltering hood was seen;  He wary often peeped beneath that russet screen.    Hard by, against the window’s adverse light,  Where desks were wont in length of row to stand,  The gowned artificers inclined to write;  The pen of silver glistened in the hand;  Some on their fingers rhyming Latin scanned;  Some textile gold from balls unwinding drew,  And on strained velvet stately portraits planned;  Here arms, there faces shone in embryo view,  At last to glittering life the total figures grew.  FOSBROOKE.FOOTNOTES:[2] DE RE DIPLOMATICA, Libri vi. in quibus quidquid ad veteruminstrumentorum antiquitatem, materiam, scripturam et stilum; quidquidad sigilla, monogrammata, subscriptiones ac notas chronologicas;quidquid inde ad antiquariam, historicam, forensemque disciplinampertinet, explicatur et illustratur.

The facts that are now to be mentioned, will furnisha sufficient solution of this question, by proving that, in the Westand in the East, during those times of general intellectual lethargy,there were more than a few individuals who cultivated polite literaturewith ardour, and to whom the possession and preservation of books was amatter of the liveliest interest. The names about to be mentioned--asthe well-informed reader will recollect--bear but a small proportionto the whole number that might be adduced: it is sufficient for ourpurpose to refer to one or two writers in each century.But before naming individual men, whose extant writings give evidenceof the continuity of literature, and therefore assure us of the safetransmission of ancient books to modern times, it will be serviceableto bring clearly into view what it is which is needed for constitutingthe LIVING MEDIUM of this transmission. Now, for bringing this matterhome to the convictions and the consciousness of the reader, lethim take up his own family history, and pursue it, retrogressively,inquiring how many individuals are needed--or let us rather say how_few_--to make up a chain of historical and literary conveyance,through any given track of time past; for instance, from this presenttime, 1858, into the mid-time of the Elizabethan era, as thus:--I will now assume the fact--whether it be true or not does not signifyto the argument--that my progenitors in a direct line were educatedpersons--or if not so--that each father in the line secured for hisson an ordinary grammar-school education--instruction just sufficientfor making him cognisant of the most noted persons and authors ofpreceding times; so that, in each case, if the father himself did notteach the son, the father’s friend and townsman, the schoolmaster,did it, as for instance:--From my father’s own lips I received therudiments of general history, and of literary history, so that in myboyhood I came to be familiar with all the principal names of publicmen and authors, up from that time to times indefinitely remote. Thisprocess of paternal instruction carries me up to the last decade ofthe eighteenth century: say, to the time of the breaking out of theFrench Revolution. But then, my father had received, either from hisfather, or from his father’s proxy, the schoolmaster, a like kind andamount of general information, by means of which we are carried up,without a break, to the times of Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, SirJoshua Reynolds; and in fact my father distinctly remembers, when aboy, seeing, and being in company with, some of these illustrious men,the friends of my grandfather. Then he had received--we will suppose--asimilar initiation in literary and political history, and if so, thenwe are furnished with stepping-stones up to the times of Bentley, Pope,Swift, Addison, Watts, and although this last name would seem to standbeyond the limit of any immediate recollections, yet it is a fact thatthe “Divine Songs” have come to me by means of a single interveningperson--from one who, as a favoured little girl, learned them, standingat the amiable doctor’s knee. Thus it is that we travel safely, andwith a distinct cognisance of the way, through more than a centuryof literary conveyance. At this rate, and if we may take this lastpreceding period of time as our gauge of centuries past, then we shallrequire the aid of only eight or nine persons, in series, to bringus into correspondence with Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Fewer thanthis--we might take six long-lived men to put us into this position ofproximity with the worthies of the Elizabethan era.In making good our supposition, it is not necessary to assume the fact(which we can seldom certainly know) that there has been, in any onefamily, a continuous succession of fathers and sons--the father livinglong enough to instruct the son. We should rather take the case ofthe intellectual filiation of college life: we imagine the learnedprofessor, during the last ten years of his official life, impartinghis mental substance to a hundred or two of scholars, some two or threeof whom, at least, will live to do the like, from the same chair, inbehalf of their successors. On this ground the individual teachers neednot be more than twelve, upon whose oral testimony, in succession, werely in passing from an age of generally diffused intelligence, to thetimes of the revival of learning, and of printed books.It will be remembered that--if indeed there were grounds of doubtconcerning the safe transmission of ancient books to modern times,any such suspicions can attach only to the period that is usuallydesignated as the “Dark Ages,” and _these_ need not be reckoned as morethan seven, reaching back from the times of Dante, Petrarch, Chaucer,Wickliffe, to the pontificate of Gregory the Great, in whose times, asappears from his writings, the learning of the preceding ages was stillfamiliarly known to more than a few.The Sixth Century of the Christian era abounds with the names ofwriters in all departments of literature, many of whose works, havingdescended to modern times, present ample evidence of the scarcelydiminished diffusion of general learning. Among many others, suchwere--Procopius, the historian of the reign of Justinian--and Agathias,who continued that history, and was a learned man;--Boethius, author ofwhat is regarded as the last specimen of pure Latinity--a poem on “theConsolations of Philosophy;”--Hesychius, the lexicographer--Proclus,a platonic philosopher;--Fulgentius, and Cassiodorus, ecclesiasticalwriters;--Priscianus, a grammarian;--Gildas the wise, anAnglo-Saxon historian;--Evagrius Scholasticus, an ecclesiasticalhistorian;--Simplicius, the commentator upon Aristotle andEpictetus;--Marcellinus Ammianus, an historian and critic, whose workscontain copious references to ancient literature; and Stephen, ofByzantium, a grammarian and geographer. We might take in hand the work
